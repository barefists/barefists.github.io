    <h2>The roles people play in meetings. </h2>
    <p>There are a number of different roles that people adopt in meetings, some of which are listed below. <strong>These roles are not always constant - one person might adopt several of these roles during one meeting</strong> or change roles depending on what is being discussed. Your score for each category should give you some idea of which of these roles you play in teams. </p>
    <h3>ENCOURAGER</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Energises groups when motivation is low through humour or through being enthusiastic.</strong>They are positive individuals who support and praise other group members. They don't like sitting around. They like to move things along by suggesting ideas, by clarifying the ideas of others and by confronting problems. They may use humour to break tensions in the group.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>They may say:</strong>
      <br />
      <em>"We CAN do this!" <br /> "That's a great idea!" </em>

    <h3>IDEAS PERSON</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>The ideas person suggests new ideas to solve group problems or suggests new ways for the group to organize the task</strong>. They dislike orthodoxy and are not too concerned with practicalities. They provide suggestions and proposals that are often original and radical. They are more concerned with the big picture than with details. They may get bored after the initial impetus wears off.
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>They may say</strong>
      <br />
      <em>"Why don't we consider doing it this way?"</em>
    </p>
    <h3>EVALUATOR</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Evaluators help the group to avoid coming to agreement too quickly.</strong>&nbsp;They tend to be slow in coming to a decision because of a need to think things over. They are the logical, analytical, objective people in the team and offer measured, dispassionate critical analysis. They contribute at times of crucial decision making because they are capable of evaluating competing proposals. They may suggest alternative ideas. <br />
      <br />
      <strong>They may say:</strong>
      <br />
      <em>"What other possibilities are there?"&nbsp; <br /> or "Let's try to look at this another way."&nbsp; <br /> or "I'm not sure we're on the right track." </em>
    </p>
    <h3>RECORDER</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>The recorder keeps the group focused and organised. They make sure that everyone is helping with the project.</strong>&nbsp;They are usually the first person to offer to take notes to keep a record of ideas and decisions. They also like to act as time-keeper, to allocate times to specific tasks and remind the team to keep to them, or act as a spokesperson, to deliver the ideas and findings of the group. They may check that all members understand and agree on plans and actions and know their roles and responsibilities. They act as the memory of the group.
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>They may say:</strong>
      <br />
      <em>
        "We only have five minutes left, so we need to come to agreement now!"<br>
        "Do we all understand this chart?"<br>
        "Are we all in agreement on this?"
