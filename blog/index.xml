      <description>&lt;p&gt;After spending a decade building games for the so-called casual audience, changing course to work on a behemoth like Stellaris has at once been inspiring, academic and humbling for me. While most of the design philosophies I&amp;rsquo;ve acquired in my career so far have been surprisingly transferable to this new genre, a lot of the practical aspects have to be relearned. In the settling dust of my scuffle with the grand strategy giant, one of the most interesting insights that has crystallized from the chaos was a newfound understanding of Paradox&amp;rsquo;s fascination with the player-driven fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My old website was hosted on a Raspberry Pi 3 hosting service run by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mythic-beasts.com/order/rpi&#34;&gt;Mythic Beasts&lt;/a&gt; that was affordable and fast enough to run a Minecraft server in parallel. The annual contract ran out this month and I was considering renewing, but my usage of the server wasn&amp;rsquo;t nearly enough to warrant spending more money on it, hence I decided to cancel instead. My portfolio site still needed a host so I required an alternative, preferably a free one. Enter Github Pages and Hugo, two things I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to try and now have a reason to.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Making My Own Arcade Fightstick</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always been interested in fighting games. Since &lt;em&gt;Street Fighter II: World Warrior&lt;/em&gt; in my youth, to &lt;em&gt;Guilty Gear XX #Reload&lt;/em&gt;, to my current favorite, &lt;em&gt;Street Fighter V: Arcade Edition&lt;/em&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve spent quite some money acquiring fightsticks for the authentic arcade experience (although the nostalgic factor is a little misplaced for me as I mostly played on consoles), but I recently got bitten by the DIY bug and started refurbishing old fightsticks to make them compatible with newer systems like the PS4. Then a voice in my head spoke to me: &amp;ldquo;Why not make one from scratch?&amp;rdquo; Another voice in my head said &amp;ldquo;That way lies madness.&amp;rdquo; I ignored the latter and got to work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
