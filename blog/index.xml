      <description>&lt;p&gt;After months of being neck-deep in development, we finally hit pause and took a proper family trip — just us, the open roads of Western Australia, and a very packed van. The plan was simple: land in Perth, wander a bit, then road trip down to Margaret River with the kids and my brother-in-law&amp;rsquo;s family. In the end, it turned out to be a pretty enjoyable trip — low-key, well-paced, and a nice break from our usual routine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always loved cars—reading about them, watching builds online, admiring them on the streets—but until recently, I’d never actually worked on one myself. That all changed when a broken side mirror pushed me to get hands-on for the first time. What started as a simple fix turned into a deep dive into DIY car mods, and before I knew it, I was designing parts, printing adapters, and upgrading my intake system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After the madness of our early access launch back in October, things have finally settled down enough for me to take a breath—and reflect. Glyphica has been a labor of love, frustration, inspiration, and a lot of late nights, and now that the dust has cleared (a little), I thought it would be a good time to do a bit of a retrospective on how this project came to be.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The random number generator (RNG) is an integral component found in numerous game engines, allowing for the introduction of chance and unpredictability. Despite its ubiquitous presence, the positioning of player decisions in relation to dice rolls is a frequently disregarded aspect. Today, we will delve into this intriguing aspect and explore how it can significantly impact the dynamics of a game.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Depth Versus Complexity in Games</title>
      <link>https://xuanmingzhou.com/blog/depth-and-complexity-in-games/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When it comes to strategy games, the discussion often revolves around the delicate balance between depth and complexity. These two concepts play a crucial role in shaping the learning curve of a game and ultimately determining its long-term engagement. In this essay, we will delve into the concept of depth and complexity in games and explore their relationship with each other.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Applied MDA: Bridging Theory and Practice</title>
      <link>https://xuanmingzhou.com/blog/applied-mechanics-dynamics-aesthetics/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Among theories of game design, Marc LeBlanc&amp;rsquo;s essay on &lt;a href=&#34;https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~hunicke/MDA.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Mechanics, Dynamics, and Aesthetics&lt;/a&gt; (MDA) stands as a seminal work. However, while MDA is widely studied in academic circles, its practical application often remains elusive, with limited examples available to aspiring designers. In this blog post, we aim to shed light on the practical aspects of applying MDA and explore its potential in game design.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was a snowy Norrland morning in the middle of October, the advent of sunless winter months to come, when it was announced that Paradox Arctic (where I work) would be collaborating with &lt;a href=&#34;https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/update-of-the-organization-at-pds.1471119/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;PDS Green&lt;/a&gt; to work on &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/281990/Stellaris/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Stellaris&lt;/a&gt;. That was a bittersweet moment for me—on one hand, Arctic had just recently endured the cancellation of a project, on the other, it was an opportunity to work on a game I enjoyed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Resource Trinity of Games</title>
      <link>https://xuanmingzhou.com/blog/the-resource-trinity-of-games/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Resources in games are usually taken for granted. They exist, of course—every game has them—but they are often overshadowed by other more elaborate and publicized mechanics. My recent foray into the realm of Grand Strategy, a genre that puts so much emphasis on resources that the games have been jokingly called spreadsheet applications, have let me appreciate how important they are in forming the backbone of a well-executed strategy game. Resources in every game can be summarily categorized into three varieties (the titular trinity), read on if this intrigues you as much as it does me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Old Buildings Are Gorgeous</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Moving to Sweden to join Paradox was motivated primarily by my love for their games and a shove forward for my career as a game designer, but at the same time, I was also entranced by Sweden&amp;rsquo;s natural beauty and colorful history. Coming from the land-scarce and constantly under-construction metropolis of Singapore, the allure of open skies and storied architecture of old is hard to resist. Over the summer break, I managed to convince my family that a 642 kilometer road trip to southern Sweden to look at old buildings was a good idea. I&amp;rsquo;m still surprised they fell for it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>In Pursuit of the Player-Driven Fantasy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After spending a decade building games for the so-called casual audience, changing course to work on a behemoth like Stellaris has at once been inspiring, academic and humbling for me. While most of the design philosophies I&amp;rsquo;ve acquired in my career so far have been surprisingly transferable to this new genre, a lot of the practical aspects have to be relearned. In the settling dust of my scuffle with the grand strategy giant, one of the most interesting insights that has crystallized from the chaos was a newfound understanding of Paradox&amp;rsquo;s fascination with the player-driven fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Migrating from Wordpress to Hugo</title>
      <link>https://xuanmingzhou.com/blog/migrating-from-wordpress-to-hugo/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 12 Jan 2021 19:40:34 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://xuanmingzhou.com/blog/migrating-from-wordpress-to-hugo/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My old website was hosted on a Raspberry Pi 3 hosting service run by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mythic-beasts.com/order/rpi&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Mythic Beasts&lt;/a&gt; that was affordable and fast enough to run a Minecraft server in parallel. The annual contract ran out this month and I was considering renewing, but my usage of the server wasn&amp;rsquo;t nearly enough to warrant spending more money on it, hence I decided to cancel instead. My portfolio site still needed a host so I required an alternative, preferably a free one. Enter Github Pages and Hugo, two things I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to try and now have a reason to.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Making My Own Arcade Fightstick</title>
      <link>https://xuanmingzhou.com/blog/making-my-own-arcade-fightstick/</link>

      <guid>https://xuanmingzhou.com/blog/making-my-own-arcade-fightstick/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always been interested in fighting games. Since &lt;em&gt;Street Fighter II: World Warrior&lt;/em&gt; in my youth, to &lt;em&gt;Guilty Gear XX #Reload&lt;/em&gt;, to my current favorite, &lt;em&gt;Street Fighter V: Arcade Edition&lt;/em&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve spent quite some money acquiring fightsticks for the authentic arcade experience (although the nostalgic factor is a little misplaced for me as I mostly played on consoles), but I recently got bitten by the DIY bug and started refurbishing old fightsticks to make them compatible with newer systems like the PS4. Then a voice in my head spoke to me: &amp;ldquo;Why not make one from scratch?&amp;rdquo; Another voice in my head said &amp;ldquo;That way lies madness.&amp;rdquo; I ignored the latter and got to work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
