		 <div class="blog-content">
			<p>Earlier this year, I submitted a job application for the lead designer position at Paradox Interactive. Much to my surprise, they got back to me. As part of the recruitment process I was required to complete a written design test. While I am not able to talk about the exact contents of the test, I took apart the economic design of Cities Skylines as part of it, and wanted to share it here.</p>

<p>Cities Skyline is an easy-to-learn, yet complex game whose systems can be divided into two large categories: Economical and Spatial.</p>
<p>Economical. Mechanics that describe the consumption of resources to create new ones. The new resources in turn generates more basic resources creating a resource loop that forms the core of the game.</p>
<p>Spatial. Land use and city planning mechanics that plays with the distances between different structures and zones. For most of the game, acts as optimization layer on top of the base economy and is not directly a part of it. That said, in the late game, when the fixed resources are depleted, this (optimization layer) becomes the core game.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that something that seems cheap in one category, usually has a cost on the other. For example, a cheap way of generating electricity is great on the economical side of the game but generates pollution on the spatial side of the game.</p>
<p>I will be mainly focusing on the core economic loop. While spatial and other optimization mechanics are an important part of Cities Skylines, they are not crucial to the understanding of the core economic loop and will not be actively discussed in this essay.</p>

<h5 id="topics-i-will-not-be-covering-are">Topics I will <strong>NOT</strong> be covering are:</h5>
<p>Traffic. Traffic is a spatial mechanic that challenges the player to move resources between parts of their city efficiently and enacts a negative multiplier on happiness and taxes earned if done badly. Although important, it functions on a layer above the core resource loop and will not be crucial in our discussion.</p>
<p>Noise and toxic pollution. Like traffic above, a spatial mechanic that takes a toll on land value (taxes) and happiness if handled with disregard.</p>
<p>Health, fire and crime. (Semi-) Randomized destruction of resources that can be prevented or mitigated with the construction of medical, firefighting and constabulary services.</p>
<p>Other optimization mechanics. Districts, policies, toll booths, <em>et cetera</em>, that tweaks rate of resource consumption and/or generation. They are adjustment layers on top of the core economic loop and are not relevant to this discussion.</p>

<p>One of the great points of Cities Skyline is the ease of learning how to play it, a large part of that gentle learning curve is the simplicity of the core game loop. Central to that game loop are 4 basic resources:</p>
<p>Time. A constant, inexhaustible and non-exclusive resource. This resource is generated at a constant rate indefinitely and shared between all structures and zones in existence at time of generation.</p>
<p>Demand. One of two basic resources generated by the player during play. It is further subdivided into Residential, Commercial and Industrial demand.</p>
<p>Land. A fixed resource. None of it is generated during play (although you can buy access to surrounding plots of land over time, but the total amount of land available is fixed). Undoubtably, it is the most scarce and valuable resource of the lot, and much of Skyline’s spatial mechanics involve the efficient use of it.</p>
<p>Money. The second generated resource. Money is probably the most user-facing resource of the lot. Laymen may even think it’s the only resource in the game, as it’s the only resource described as the “cost” of structures in the user interface.</p>
<h4 id="composite-resources">Composite Resources</h4>

</figure>
<p>Composite resources are created by combining basic resources. I have grouped up similar types of composite resources to aid the visualization. There are 3 categories of them.</p>
<h5 id="player-created">Player Created</h5>
<p>Roads. Most structures and zones cannot be built without being connected to a road, making it a very crucial resource. There are different types of roads, all of them influence traffic in different ways, a few affect beauty of an area, and in turn increase the happiness of people nearby.</p>
<p>Utilities. Utilities are basic services without which zones and structures cannot function. Its main purpose is to support the generation of people. This includes electricity, water and sewage.</p>
<p>Services. Services are structures that influence the education and happiness of surrounding people. For example, schools, parks, fire stations, clinics, et cetera. As mentioned earlier, some services also help with preventing/mitigating fires, disease and crime.</p>
<h5 id="player-seeded">Player Seeded</h5>
<p>Housing. Housing, supplied with the right utilities, generate people. There are two types of them, high density and low density, the former houses more people, but generate more traffic coming to and from them.</p>
<p>Shops. Shops are where people spend the money they earn. Like Housing, they come in low- and high-density flavours. Demand for shops grow when people are employed and earn money to spend.</p>
<p>Industries. Industries are where most people earn their money. Oil industries, farming, mining, forestry and offices all count as industries. Demand for this comes when people are unemployed and need jobs.</p>
<h5 id="generated">Generated</h5>
<p>People. The main “scoring” resource for Skylines. The amount of people you have determines the size of your city, and in turn, unlocks new structures. Although it’s mainly throttled by the amount of housing available, all resources are involved in the healthy growth of people.</p>
<p>Happiness/Education. These are modifiers on top of people, and as will be explained below in the Resource Loops section, act as multipliers in the resource loop. This is mainly influenced by the services you build for your citizens, such as schools, garbage disposal, cemeteries, police stations, <em>et cetera</em>.</p>
<h4 id="resource-loop">Resource Loop</h4>

<p>The crux of every good economic system is the loop – or rather, the upward spiral – of resources, where the player produces composite resources to generate more basic resources to continue the cycle. Skylines is no exception, here are a few key concepts from their loop.</p>
<p>Taxes. Taxes are the mainstay of every city building sim – it’s the primary way players generate money. In Skyline, taxes are imposed on residential, commercial and industrial zones. An unspoken rule, of course, is that since it’s a tax on the earnings of resources in those zones, there needs to be people living, shopping or working there before taxes can be extracted.</p>
<p>Jobs/Shops. Money isn’t the only generated resource in Skylines, demand is a large part of the economy too. As the population grows, the demand for shops and jobs grows as well, feeding back into the economical loop as Commercial and Industrial demand respectively.</p>
<p>Workers. As Shops and Industries grow due to population growth, they too, generate demand for workers, which feeds back into the loop as Residential demand.</p>
<p>Happiness/Education. Happiness and Education act as multipliers on the economy in Skylines. More taxes are collected when happiness is high, and buildings level up faster, which in turn nets more taxes. Education works the same way, if there are jobs that reward a higher education level.</p>
