      <description>&lt;p&gt;Resources in games are usually taken for granted. They exist, of course—every game has them—but my recent exploits in Grand Strategy, a genre that puts so much emphasis on them that some have referred to the games as spreadsheet applications, have started to let me appreciate how they can form the backbone of a well-executed strategy game. Resources in every game can be categorized generally into three types (the titular trinity), read on if this intrigues you as much as it does me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>In Pursuit of the Player-Driven Fantasy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After spending a decade building games for the so-called casual audience, changing course to work on a behemoth like Stellaris has at once been inspiring, academic and humbling for me. While most of the design philosophies I&amp;rsquo;ve acquired in my career so far have been surprisingly transferable to this new genre, a lot of the practical aspects have to be relearned. In the settling dust of my scuffle with the grand strategy giant, one of the most interesting insights that has crystallized from the chaos was a newfound understanding of Paradox&amp;rsquo;s fascination with the player-driven fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, I submitted a job application for the lead designer position at Paradox Interactive. Much to my surprise, they got back to me. As part of the recruitment process I was required to complete a written design test. While I am not able to talk about the exact contents of the test, I took apart the economic design of Cities Skylines as part of it, and wanted to share it here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
