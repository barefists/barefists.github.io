      <description>&lt;p&gt;The random number generator (RNG) is an integral component found in numerous game engines, allowing for the introduction of chance and unpredictability. Despite its ubiquitous presence, the positioning of player decisions in relation to dice rolls is a frequently disregarded aspect. Today, we will delve into this intriguing aspect and explore how it can significantly impact the dynamics of a game.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When it comes to strategy games, the discussion often revolves around the delicate balance between depth and complexity. These two concepts play a crucial role in shaping the learning curve of a game and ultimately determining its long-term engagement. In this essay, we will delve into the concept of depth and complexity in games and explore their relationship with each other.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Applied MDA: Bridging Theory and Practice</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Among theories of game design, Marc LeBlanc&amp;rsquo;s essay on &lt;a href=&#34;https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~hunicke/MDA.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Mechanics, Dynamics, and Aesthetics&lt;/a&gt; (MDA) stands as a seminal work. However, while MDA is widely studied in academic circles, its practical application often remains elusive, with limited examples available to aspiring designers. In this blog post, we aim to shed light on the practical aspects of applying MDA and explore its potential in game design.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was a snowy Norrland morning in the middle of October, the advent of sunless winter months to come, when it was announced that Paradox Arctic (where I work) would be collaborating with &lt;a href=&#34;https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/update-of-the-organization-at-pds.1471119/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;PDS Green&lt;/a&gt; to work on &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/281990/Stellaris/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Stellaris&lt;/a&gt;. That was a bittersweet moment for me—on one hand, Arctic had just recently endured the cancellation of a project, on the other, it was an opportunity to work on a game I enjoyed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Resource Trinity of Games</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Resources in games are usually taken for granted. They exist, of course—every game has them—but they are often overshadowed by other more elaborate and publicized mechanics. My recent foray into the realm of Grand Strategy, a genre that puts so much emphasis on resources that the games have been jokingly called spreadsheet applications, have let me appreciate how important they are in forming the backbone of a well-executed strategy game. Resources in every game can be summarily categorized into three varieties (the titular trinity), read on if this intrigues you as much as it does me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>In Pursuit of the Player-Driven Fantasy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After spending a decade building games for the so-called casual audience, changing course to work on a behemoth like Stellaris has at once been inspiring, academic and humbling for me. While most of the design philosophies I&amp;rsquo;ve acquired in my career so far have been surprisingly transferable to this new genre, a lot of the practical aspects have to be relearned. In the settling dust of my scuffle with the grand strategy giant, one of the most interesting insights that has crystallized from the chaos was a newfound understanding of Paradox&amp;rsquo;s fascination with the player-driven fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
