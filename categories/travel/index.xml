      <description>&lt;p&gt;After months of being neck-deep in development, we finally hit pause and took a proper family trip — just us, the open roads of Western Australia, and a very packed van. The plan was simple: land in Perth, wander a bit, then road trip down to Margaret River with the kids and my brother-in-law&amp;rsquo;s family. In the end, it turned out to be a pretty enjoyable trip — low-key, well-paced, and a nice break from our usual routine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Moving to Sweden to join Paradox was motivated primarily by my love for their games and a shove forward for my career as a game designer, but at the same time, I was also entranced by Sweden&amp;rsquo;s natural beauty and colorful history. Coming from the land-scarce and constantly under-construction metropolis of Singapore, the allure of open skies and storied architecture of old is hard to resist. Over the summer break, I managed to convince my family that a 642 kilometer road trip to southern Sweden to look at old buildings was a good idea. I&amp;rsquo;m still surprised they fell for it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
