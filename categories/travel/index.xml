      <description>&lt;p&gt;Moving to Sweden to join Paradox was motivated primarily by my love for their games and a shove forward for my career as a game designer, but at the same time, I was also entranced by Sweden&amp;rsquo;s natural beauty and colorful history. Coming from the land-scarce and constantly under-construction metropolis of Singapore, the allure of open skies and storied architecture of old is hard to resist. Over the summer break, I managed to convince my family that a 642 kilometer road trip to southern Sweden to look at old buildings was a good idea. I&amp;rsquo;m still surprised they fell for it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
