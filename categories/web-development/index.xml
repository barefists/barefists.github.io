      <description>&lt;p&gt;My old website was hosted on a Raspberry Pi 3 hosting service run by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mythic-beasts.com/order/rpi&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Mythic Beasts&lt;/a&gt; that was affordable and fast enough to run a Minecraft server in parallel. The annual contract ran out this month and I was considering renewing, but my usage of the server wasn&amp;rsquo;t nearly enough to warrant spending more money on it, hence I decided to cancel instead. My portfolio site still needed a host so I required an alternative, preferably a free one. Enter Github Pages and Hugo, two things I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to try and now have a reason to.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
